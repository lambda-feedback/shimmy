# `wasiEvalPython` Reactor example

`wasiEvalPython` is a small experimental `demo` / `io_test` / `unit_test`
evaluator for student Python. It runs in-process inside the Python Reactor WASM
profile, without adapting the Linux `evaluatePython` implementation or starting
CPython or Node subprocesses.

## Start here: first successful evaluation

You need a Shimmy Python Reactor artifact and its matching manifest. Producer
artifacts are immutable CI outputs rather than Git blobs: obtain both files from
the same trusted Producer build, verify the bundle's published checksums and
provenance, and keep them together.

From the repository root, start the evaluator:

```bash
examples/wasi-eval-python/serve.sh \
  /path/to/shimmy-python-runtime-base.wasm \
  /path/to/manifest.json
```

The launcher validates the artifact/manifest contract before starting Shimmy.
It uses `go run` by default, so contributors do not need a preinstalled Shimmy
binary. It requires Bash, Python 3, and curl; Go is only required when the two
prebuilt Shimmy binaries are not supplied. In another terminal, run the guided examples:

```bash
examples/wasi-eval-python/try.sh base
```

This sends real HTTP requests for:

1. captured demo output;
2. passing public and hidden input/output tests;
3. a failing test and its student-facing feedback;
4. evaluator-defined unit tests; and
5. preview rejection of a blocked host capability.

Every response is printed and checked. `try.sh` waits up to 90 seconds for the
listener, so it can be started while the Reactor is still preparing. The command
exits non-zero if the running system does not match the documented contract.

For a richer artifact, use the same flow and name its profile when trying it:

```bash
examples/wasi-eval-python/serve.sh /path/to/numpy-core.wasm /path/to/manifest.json
examples/wasi-eval-python/try.sh numpy-core

examples/wasi-eval-python/serve.sh /path/to/sympy.wasm /path/to/manifest.json
examples/wasi-eval-python/try.sh sympy
```

The onboarding launcher uses a 5-second worker deadline for `base` and
`numpy-core`, and 30 seconds for SymPy's heavier first import. Override it with
`SHIMMY_WASI_EVAL_TIMEOUT`. These are demonstration defaults, not production
SLOs: measure the chosen profile on the deployment platform and set the shortest
deadline that supports legitimate exercises.

The request bodies are ordinary JSON files under [`requests/`](requests/).
Copy one and change `response`, `mode`, and `tests` to prototype a real exercise;
no client SDK is required.

## What to hand to another team

The smallest useful handoff bundle is:

```text
shimmy-wasi-eval/
├── shimmy
├── shimmy-artifact-check
├── runtime.wasm
├── manifest.json
├── SHA256SUMS
└── examples/wasi-eval-python/
    ├── wasi_eval_python.py
    ├── serve.sh
    ├── try.sh
    └── requests/
```

Set `SHIMMY_BIN` and `SHIMMY_ARTIFACT_CHECK_BIN` to the two shipped binaries;
then `serve.sh` needs no Go toolchain. The deployment owner must still verify
the bundle's signature/provenance and apply platform memory, concurrency, and
request-deadline policy. Do not give users a loose WASM file without its exact
manifest and provenance receipt.

### Keep the roles separate

| Role | Starts from | Usually changes | Must not control |
|---|---|---|---|
| Platform owner | `serve.sh`, artifact, manifest | deployment paths, signatures, memory/concurrency/deadlines | per-request capability expansion |
| Evaluator author | `wasi_eval_python.py` and its tests | trusted grading modes and fixed limits | artifact provenance or host mounts |
| Exercise author | a file in `requests/` | student starter code, public/hidden tests, expected output | trusted evaluator source or runtime limits |
| Student/client | HTTP `response` field | submitted Python | tests, manifest, filesystem/network policy |

For a first workshop, the platform owner starts one `base` instance and runs
`try.sh` once. Exercise authors then copy `io-tests-pass.json` or
`unit-tests.json`; they should not need to understand WASI or modify deployment
environment variables. Move to `numpy-core` or `sympy` only when an exercise
actually requires those packages.

`serve.sh` is a contributor/onboarding launcher. Production should use the same
validated inputs with a pinned Shimmy binary and platform-managed process,
logging, authentication, resource limits, and artifact provenance policy.

## Why this path

AWS Lambda cannot grant the namespaces or capabilities required to make nsjail
a usable runtime boundary. A Python engine that exposes host-process or
JavaScript bridges is likewise not the capability boundary used by this example.

The Reactor path works within Lambda's normal process constraints:

- wazero provides the host boundary;
- `FUNCTION_WASM_ALLOWED_PATHS` must remain empty, so no host directory is
  mounted into WASI;
- the selected artifact and manifest are verified before execution;
- request deadlines close a non-terminating WASM module;
- snapshot lifecycle restores prepared memory after every request;
- a failed or timed-out snapshot slot is closed and replaced;
- code, input, test count, and output have explicit evaluator limits.

The AST checks in `wasi_eval_python.py` provide early feedback and reduce accidental
misuse. They are not claimed as the sandbox. The WASM capability boundary,
request deadline, memory limit, and state reset are the security controls.

## Backend selection

Use a signed Producer artifact and its matching manifest:

```bash
export FUNCTION_INTERFACE=wasm
export FUNCTION_WASM_PROFILE=python-reactor
export FUNCTION_WASM_MODULE=/opt/shimmy/runtime/shimmy-python-runtime-base.wasm
export FUNCTION_WASM_MANIFEST=/opt/shimmy/runtime/shimmy-python-runtime-base.manifest.json
export FUNCTION_WASM_PYTHON_SCRIPT="$PWD/examples/wasi-eval-python/wasi_eval_python.py"
export FUNCTION_WASM_PYTHON_LIFECYCLE=snapshot
export FUNCTION_WASM_ALLOWED_PATHS=
export FUNCTION_MAX_PROCS=1
export FUNCTION_WORKER_SEND_TIMEOUT=5s

shimmy serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

The evaluator is below the 1 MiB trusted-script limit and only uses the standard
library. Package availability comes from the manifest-validated artifact profile, never
from runtime pip or network installation:

| Student-code requirement | Backend/artifact |
|---|---|
| Standard library | Python Reactor `base` |
| NumPy | Python Reactor `numpy-core` |
| SymPy + mpmath | Python Reactor `sympy` |
| Existing trusted evaluator requiring SciPy or subprocesses | Existing RPC/container backend (outside this example) |

Do not silently fall back between these paths. Switching the module, manifest,
and runner is deployment configuration.

Runtime manifest validation establishes digest, ABI, imports/exports, and
capability consistency. Artifact authenticity, trusted Producer commit policy,
and digital-signature verification remain deployment-system responsibilities.

## Request examples

Shimmy's `eval` schema requires a non-null `answer`; use an empty string when a
mode does not need one. The `preview` schema does not accept `answer`.

### Demo

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Command: eval' \
  --data '{"response":"print(6 * 7)","answer":"","params":{"mode":"demo"}}'
```

Demo returns captured stdout and `is_correct: false`; it displays execution
output but does not claim a pass condition.

### Input/output tests

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Command: eval' \
  --data '{
    "response":"n = int(input())\nprint(n * n)",
    "answer":"",
    "params":{"mode":"io_test","tests":[
      {"input":"5\n","expected_output":"25\n"},
      {"input":"3\n","expected_output":"9\n","hidden":true}
    ]}
  }'
```

Each test receives a fresh Python namespace. Hidden test details omit actual and
expected output. An `inject` object can initialize variables before execution:

```json
{"inject":{"n":5},"expected_output":"25\n"}
```

### Unit tests

The example intentionally implements a small contract: zero-argument functions
whose names begin with `test_`; a failed `assert` fails that test.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Command: eval' \
  --data '{
    "response":"def square(n):\n    return n * n",
    "answer":"",
    "params":{"mode":"unit_test","test_code":"def test_square():\n    assert square(5) == 25"}
  }'
```

### Preview

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Command: preview' \
  --data '{"response":"import socket","params":{}}'
```

## Built-in evaluator limits

The limits are constants in the trusted script and cannot be raised by request
parameters:

| Limit | Value |
|---|---:|
| Student code | 64 KiB |
| Captured stdout/stderr retained in memory per stream/execution | 64 KiB, enforced while writing |
| Input per test | 64 KiB |
| Tests per request | 32 |

The deployment additionally controls the Reactor memory-page limit and Shimmy
request deadline. Keep the HTTP/worker deadline short enough to bound infinite
loops and long enough for the selected profile's normal work.

## Verification

Host-side behavior tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest examples/wasi-eval-python/wasi_eval_python_test.py -v
```

Full Linux path with a real Producer artifact:

```bash
SHIMMY_PYTHON_REACTOR_WASM=/path/to/base.wasm \
SHIMMY_PYTHON_REACTOR_MANIFEST=/path/to/base.manifest.json \
scripts/e2e-wasi-eval-python.sh
```

The E2E covers all three modes, preview rejection, timeout of an infinite loop,
and successful recovery through a replacement snapshot slot. No Docker,
privileged Lambda configuration, runtime package installation, or nsjail is
required.
